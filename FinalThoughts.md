## Final Thoughts

My first blog post, “Digital Media and Databases,’ was discussing the importance of Digital media in the Database world. I still stand by this article. Nothing has changed. This is to be expected, though. Even those who do not wish to participate in the realm of technical writing in our field understand the significance and rely heavily on those who do write. 

While my understanding and thoughts as a composer have not changed since the start of this semester, this course force me to focus on subjects I had not thought to before. Copyright is not something that comes up often in my line of work. I have even started wondering if anything Database Related is even considered copyrightable. I had also not consider using wiki to view subjects from my field. Looking at the article, I can see that must be true for many professionals given how little is written there. 

Writing the Wiki article was definitely the most challenging assignment. The topics related to my field are dry and straight forward. I was limited on what I could write, so I researched the history instead. I was also embarrassed by my skill level when attempting to write it. I am not a fan of using jargon. It creates a barrier between the advanced level dbas and the lower level/general population. Using jargon created an article only people who already know what it is can read. At that point, what is even the point of posting it? The other articles were full of jargon. This made trying to think of things for the article even harder. I did not feel comfortable writing as myself or as a professional like the other wikis. 

Overall, this course made me think a bit more about what now seem obviously important topics. I hope that will make me a better writer in the future as I continue to learn more about these topics.
