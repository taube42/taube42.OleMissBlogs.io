## Who Even Reads These?

There are three groups of audiences reading a technical blog. The first group consists of juniors who are looking to you for help learning something. The second group consists of companies who have a problem and are looking for someone to help solve it. The first group consists of the other technical professionals who are looking to stay current or trying to solve a problem they have never seen before. It can be difficult to write in such a way that keeps all three groups in mind. The first may or may not have the basics down. The second usually has the minimal exposure to the technical side. The third group can understand the more advanced subjects and pick up what you are trying to demonstrate by just reading a few sentences. I will be using my coworkers blog as an example. She is a well-known blogger in the SQL Server community.

Juniors do not have the level of knowledge needed to condense a blog down to a few words. They need explanations. Plus, jargon can be intimidating. 

Technical blogs are interesting in that they are not just for technical users. They are also for potential clients. When drafting a technical essay, the author needs to keep that in mind. It is important to make sure that your writing can be understood to some degree by someone with a nontechnical background. Your blog in some ways a portfolio by itself. It demonstrates what you know and how well you know it. We have gotten many clients who said they joined us because of one of our coworkers.

Technical professionals do not want to see a lengthy document to explain something that can be shortened to a few words. They understand all the jargon and just want to get to the point. They will get bored of reading and move onto the next blog if not. I have found that breaking up technical blogs into sections with headers makes a difference. That way the professionals can easily skip past the information that they do not need to know and go straight to the parts that they do need to know. 

This image shows how she created a summary at the bottom to skip to if you did not want to read the breakdown.
