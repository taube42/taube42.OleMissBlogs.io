## Microsoft Wiki Pages are Lacking


While reading Wikipedia articles on my chosen topic, I noticed something that I have not before. Wikipedia is sparse on information involving my career field. The older topics such as the page for SQL Server, only contain the essentials. Though, they do give a decent bit of information towards the older features because of the age of the technology.  For example, I was disapointed to not find information on the SQL Query Store. This is a fantastic feature that was add in SQL Serer 2016. So the newer features, (if you still consider 2016 new) are not really touched on.

Power Platform page for SharePoint is even worse. Most of the power platforms do not even have a page at all or information on what they are. They are just listed. The ones that do, other than Power Bi, are the bare minimum such as history.

The question that might come to mind is why is there so little information on Wikipedia about these subjects? 

I would image this has to do with the nature of the tech field. When we wish to learn something, we go to blogs or ask others in our field. There are many speaking events available to learn more, as well.

Microsoft themselves could also be to blame. They offer extensive information on their learning site. Anything you might want to know can be found there and even converted into a pdf to be saved.

I do not feel like this is enough, though. It is helpful to those using SQL Server, but it does not consider students who are trying to learn what it is. Microsoftâ€™s learning portal is great for learning how to use a tool, but it does not really help explain why you would use it. Blogs help fill in the gaps, but you must read many blogs before that knowledge gap is filled. Having wiki pages focused on explaining what a product is and its uses would be fantastic. This is especially true for the features.
