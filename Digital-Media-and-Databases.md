## Digital Media and Databases

Digital media plays a significant role in my career for two reasons. It advertises my services and provides important training material. I am a SharePoint Administrator and SQL Server Database Administrator for a company that contracts me out for other companies to utilize. 

 As a SharePoint Administrator, I am often designing and creating new sites to relay essential information to its users. These sites need to be designed in such a way that the users with WANT to utilize it for the information I am trying to relay. The pages must be clear and concise. It must also be aesthetically pleasing and related to the company. 

As a Database Admin, digital media is how we bring in clients. This includes things such as an appealing website design, blogs detailing how to do technical skills, and a YouTube channel where we have “lunch time snippets.”

I am currently not as involved in the digital media side of the company as I would like to be. There is always a push to get more content out there to make us more searchable and relevant. That and my minor in Professional Writing is why I am taking this course. I want to be more initiative-taking within the company. 

For this blog I would like to add my company’s digital media sites. No, this is not advertisement. It just best represents what I am trying to accomplish.
