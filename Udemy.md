My favorite self-paced training site is actually a paid site called Udemy. You locate the course you are looking for and purchase it. There are many options to choose from. You can also preview courses to see if they are what you are looking for. They also have a great return policy for courses that don't live up to what you are expecting.

They courses are a bit on the expensive side, but there is an option for a less expensive plan for $30 a month with focus personal goals. I do not do either of these options, though. I wait until their sales. They usually have courses reduced from $80+ to as little as $11 dollars.  For example, I purchased the course called "Become a Probability & Statistics Master" when I was struggling in my statistics class. It is $199.99; however, I only paid $30. For that reason, it's a good idea to hold off on purchasing until they have sales.
